      <description>Usually in CDS a build pipeline is structured of the following stages :
 Compile stage : Build the binaries Analysis &amp;amp; Unit Tests stage : Run all unit tests and analyse code quality Packaging stage : Build the final package, Virtual Machine Image or Docker Image.  In CDS, stages are executed sequentially if the previous stage is successful.
You can define trigger conditions on a stage, to enable/disable it under given conditions.</description>

      <description>What is CDS? Enterprise-Grade Continuous Delivery &amp;amp; DevOps Automation Open Source Platform
 Easy to deploy Cloud native Scalable &amp;amp; Extensible Infrastructure &amp;amp; Architecture agnostic Event-Driven Pipeline  Designed for scalability, CDS tasks can run either on cloud infrastructure or on your own machines, should you start some workers using a hatchery.
CDS exposes an API available to workers and humans through CLI or WebUI.
What does CDS do? Basically, CDS allows users to create building and delivery pipelines for all your applications.</description>

      <description>A pipeline describes how things need to be executed in order to obtain the expected result. In CDS, a pipeline belongs to a single project and can be used with the applications of that project.
A pipeline is structured in sequential stages containing one or multiple concurrent jobs.
In CDS there are several types of pipelines : build, testing and deployment. In Pipeline configuration file, default type is build.</description>

      <description>Project A project contains applications, pipelines and environments.
A project is the first level of permissions management. Any CDS application has to be created inside a project.
The project key has to be unique among all projects in CDS.
At creation, a project has to have at least one group with edition permissions on it. It is possible to use either an existing group or create a new one.</description>

      <title>Job</title>

      <description>A Job is an important concept in CDS. A job is composed of steps which will be run sequentially. A Job is executed in a dedicated workspace and each new run of a job will have a new dedicated workspace. This means that you cannot share a workspace between jobs or between two runs of the same job.
A Job is executed by a worker. CDS will select or provision a worker for the job dependending on the Requirements the job&amp;rsquo;s requirements.</description>

      <title>Step</title>

      <guid>https://ovh.github.io/cds/introduction/introduction.concepts.step/</guid>
      <description>The steps of a job is the list of the different operations performed by the CDS worker. Each step is based on an Action pre-defined by CDS. The list of all actions is defined on *&amp;lt;your cds url ui&amp;gt;/#/action*. When a step fails, its parent job is stopped and marked as failed.
You can define a Step as final. It mean that even if the job fails before reaching it, the step will be executed anyway.</description>
